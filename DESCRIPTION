Description: SEA performs simultaneous feature-set testing for (gen)omics data. It tests the unified null hypothesis controls the family-wise error rate for all possible pathways. The unified null hypothesis is defined as: "The proportion of true features in the set is less than or equal to the threshold c", where c is selected by the user. Family-wise error rate control is provided through use of closed testing with Simes test. For more information on closed testing with Simes see Goeman et al. (2019) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asz041> and for more information about the properties and performance of SEA procedure see Ebrahimpoor et al. (2019) <doi:10.1093/bib/bbz074>.
